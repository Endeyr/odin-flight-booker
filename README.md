# odin_flight_booker

Project
Flight Booker Website project as part of The Odin Project, you can find it here https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker.

Difficulties
First time working with a database as well as seeding that database using Faker produced some interesting challenges. I also learned how to incorporate simple forms into my html.

Notable Features
User can search flights by date or city, then book up to four tickets.
